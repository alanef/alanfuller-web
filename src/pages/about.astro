            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8">From Corporate to Entrepreneur</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">
              I've spent over four decades working with technology. From corporate mainframes to cloud computing to AI.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
              My path: contractor → developer → project manager → team leader → CTO/CIO. Then 20 years ago, I made the leap to entrepreneurship.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8">Learning the Hard Way</h3>

            <p class="mb-4">
              My independent journey began building web solutions for my son's business ventures. This taught me a crucial lesson: technology should serve business needs, not the other way around.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
              I then acquired and operated an e-commerce business for a year. It gave me firsthand insight into the operational challenges small businesses face daily.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8 clear-left">Finding My Mission</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">
              I pivoted to building a PPC agency. It naturally evolved into a WordPress development shop.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              This transition sparked my core mission: creating practical business solutions. What started as free tools to solve common problems grew into a sustainable commercial venture.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
              Along the way, I became a cloud consultant and Google Partner. A brief exploration into business coaching solidified my understanding: my true value lies in building solutions, not just advising about them.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8">My Expertise</h3>

            </figure>

            <p class="mb-6">
              Throughout my career, I've developed expertise in solution selection. I understand not just what's technically possible, but what actually works for real businesses with real constraints.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6 mt-12 clear-right">Why Small Business?</h2>

            <p class="mb-4">
              Small businesses are the backbone of our economy. Yet they often lack resources for enterprise-level solutions.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
              Having operated in both corporate and small business environments, I understand the unique challenges each faces. Every business deserves reliable, affordable tools that solve real problems without requiring extensive technical expertise.
            </p>
