            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">My Journey</h2>
            
            <p class="mb-6">
              I've spent over four decades navigating the evolution of technology—from corporate mainframes to cloud computing to AI. My path has taken me from contractor to developer, project manager to team leader, and eventually to CTO and CIO roles before I made the leap to entrepreneurship 20 years ago.
            </p>
            
            <p class="mb-6">
              My independent journey began by building web solutions for my son's business ventures—an invaluable learning experience that taught me how technology should serve real business needs, not the other way around. I then acquired and operated an e-commerce business for a year, which gave me firsthand insight into the operational challenges small businesses face daily.
            </p>
            
            <p class="mb-6">
              Seeking less operational complexity and more strategic focus, I pivoted to building a PPC agency, which naturally evolved into a WordPress development shop. This transition sparked what would become my core mission: creating practical business solutions in the form of WordPress plugins. What started as free tools to solve common problems gradually grew into a sustainable commercial venture.
            </p>
            
            <p class="mb-6">
              Along the way, I deepened my expertise as a cloud consultant and became a Google Partner, helping businesses navigate the rapidly changing technology landscape. A brief exploration into business coaching actually solidified my understanding that my true value lies in building technology solutions rather than just advising about them.
            </p>
            
            <p class="mb-6">
              Throughout both my corporate and entrepreneurial careers, I've developed a particular expertise in solution selection—understanding not just what's technically possible, but what actually works for real businesses with real constraints.
            </p>
            
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6 mt-12">Why Small Business?</h2>
            
            <p class="mb-6">
              Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, yet they often lack the resources for enterprise-level solutions. Having operated in both corporate and small business environments, I understand the unique challenges each faces. I believe every business deserves reliable, affordable tools that solve real problems without requiring extensive technical expertise.
            </p>
            
            <p class="mb-6">
              Today, I focus on developing solutions that are:
            </p>
            
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Easy to implement without technical expertise</li>
              <li>Affordable for small business budgets</li>
              <li>Effective at solving common operational challenges</li>
              <li>Backed by responsive, personal support</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="mb-6">
              My WordPress plugins and monitoring tools now protect over 80,000 websites worldwide, and with the emergence of AI, I'm exploring new ways to help businesses leverage these powerful technologies practically and affordably.
